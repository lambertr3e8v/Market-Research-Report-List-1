<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geiger Muller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alpha Particle</li><li>Beta Particle</li><li>Gamma Particle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geiger-Muller (GM) market types refer to the detection of different radiation particles: alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha particle detectors are designed to sense helium nuclei, which are heavily charged but short-range, making them less penetrative. Beta particle detectors target high-speed electrons or positrons, capable of penetrating slightly further into materials. Gamma particle detectors, conversely, identify high-energy electromagnetic radiation, which can penetrate deeply, requiring denser materials for effective shielding. Each type serves distinct applications in radiation monitoring and safety.</p></p>
