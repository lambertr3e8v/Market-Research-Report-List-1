<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Satellite Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Satellite Sensor</li><li>Passive Satellite Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The satellite sensor market is divided into two main types: active and passive sensors. Active satellite sensors emit their own energy, such as radar or LiDAR, to illuminate the target and measure the reflected signals, allowing for all-weather and day-and-night capabilities. In contrast, passive satellite sensors detect natural energy, primarily sunlight, reflecting off surfaces, making them reliant on ambient light conditions. Both types play crucial roles in Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.</p></p>
