<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrophobic Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrophobic intraocular lens (IOL) market is categorized into two main types: non-preloaded IOLs and pre-loaded IOLs. Non-preloaded IOLs require manual loading into a surgical injector prior to implantation, which can offer flexibility but may increase the risk of handling errors. In contrast, pre-loaded IOLs come pre-packaged in a sterile injector, ensuring ease of use and reducing procedural time and potential contamination risks during cataract surgery. Both types aim to enhance visual outcomes for patients undergoing lens replacement.</p></p>
