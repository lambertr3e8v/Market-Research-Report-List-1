<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Anchors/Fasteners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Anchors/Fasteners</li><li>Adhesive Anchors/Fasteners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete anchors/fasteners market comprises two primary types: mechanical anchors and adhesive anchors. Mechanical anchors rely on mechanical interlock or expansion to secure themselves within concrete, ensuring high-load capacity for applications like structural support and heavy equipment installation. In contrast, adhesive anchors use a bonding agent to secure rebar or bolts in drilled holes, offering superior resistance to environmental factors and vibration. Both types are essential in construction and renovation projects, addressing various load requirements and installation conditions.</p></p>
