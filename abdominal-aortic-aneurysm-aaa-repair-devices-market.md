<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Graft System</li><li>Endovascular Stent Graft System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair devices market comprises two main types: synthetic graft systems and endovascular stent graft systems. Synthetic graft systems involve the surgical placement of a durable synthetic material to replace the weakened aorta, providing structural support. Conversely, endovascular stent graft systems utilize a minimally invasive technique, where a stent graft is inserted through the blood vessels to reinforce the aneurysm wall. Both approaches aim to prevent rupture and reduce complications associated with AAA.</p></p>
